        sgns_vi.py [-l] <modelPath> <corpDir> <outPath> <windowSize> <dim> <k> <t> <minCount> <itera>
        
    Arguments:
       
        <modelPath> = model for initialization
        <corpDir> = path to corpus directory with zipped files, each sentence in form 'year\tword1 word2 word3...'

        <windowSize> = the linear distance of context words to consider in each direction
        <dim> = dimensionality of embeddings
        <k> = number of negative samples parameter (equivalent to shifting parameter for PPMI)
        <t> = threshold for subsampling
        <minCount> = number of occurrences for a word to be included in the vocabulary
        <itera> = number of iterations

    Options:
        -l, --len   normalize final vectors to unit length

        This script has been updated considerably compared to the version used in

        The Skip Gram Model consist of three layers, the input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Weights between the input layer and the hidden layer are stored in the Embedding Matrix, which is later used for getting the individual word embeddings by looking at only one column of the Matrix. The Context matrix stores the weights between the hidden layer and the output layer.

        Differences:
        In the original version for training on the second corpus only the previously created Embedding Matrix was loaded into the new model, so the Context matrix is newly initialized with random values. In the updated version the whole model is reused for training on the second corpus, that includes the Embedding Matrix as well as the Context matrix.
