Also make sure you give appropriate credit to the below-mentioned software this repository depends on.

Parts of the code rely on [DISSECT](https://github.com/composes-toolkit/dissect), [gensim](https://github.com/rare-technologies/gensim), [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/), [scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/), [VecMap](https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap).

### Usage

The scripts should be run directly from the main directory. If you wish to do otherwise, you may have to change the path you add to the path attribute in `sys.path.append('./modules/')` in the scripts. All scripts can be run directly from the command line:

	python3 representations/count.py <corpDir> <outPath> <windowSize>

e.g.

	python3 representations/count.py corpora/test/corpus1/ test_matrix1 1

The usage of each script can be understood by running it with help option `-h`, e.g.:

	python3 representations/count.py -h

We recommend you to run the scripts within a [virtual environment](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) with Python 3.7.4. Install the required packages running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Models

A standard model of LSC detection executes three consecutive steps:

1. learn semantic representations from corpora (`representations/`)
2. align representations (`alignment/`)
3. measure change (`measures/`)

As an example, consider a very simple model (CNT+CI+CD) going through these steps:

1. learn count vectors from each corpus to compare (`representations/count.py`)
2. align them by intersecting their columns (`alignment/ci_align.py`)
3. measure change with cosine distance (`measures/cd.py`)

You can apply this model to the testing data using the following commands:

        python3 representations/count.py corpora/test/corpus1/ test_matrix1 1
        python3 representations/count.py corpora/test/corpus2/ test_matrix2 1

        python3 alignment/ci_align.py test_matrix1 test_matrix2 test_matrix1_aligned test_matrix2_aligned

        python3 measures/cd.py -s testsets/test/targets.tsv test_matrix1_aligned test_matrix2_aligned test_results.tsv

__Input Format__: All the scripts in this repository can handle two types of matrix input formats:

- sparse scipy matrices stored in [npz format](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.save_npz.html)
- dense matrices stored in [word2vec plain text format](https://tedboy.github.io/nlps/generated/generated/gensim.models.Word2Vec.save_word2vec_format.html)
 
To learn more about how matrices are loaded and stored check out `modules/utils_.py`.

The scripts assume a corpus format of one sentence per line in UTF-8 encoded (optionally zipped) text files. You can specify either a file path or a folder. In the latter case the scripts will iterate over all files in the folder.

#### Semantic Representations

|Name | Code | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Count | `representations/count.py` | VSM |
| PPMI | `representations/ppmi.py` | VSM |
| SVD | `representations/svd.py` | VSM |
| RI | `representations/ri.py` | VSM |
| SGNS | `representations/sgns.py` | VSM |
| SCAN | [repository](https://github.com/ColiLea/scan) | TPM |

Table: VSM=Vector Space Model, TPM=Topic Model

Note that SCAN takes a slightly different corpus input format than the other models.

#### Alignment

|Name | Code | Applicability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CI | `alignment/ci_align.py` | Count, PPMI |
| SRV | `alignment/srv_align.py` | RI |
| OP | `alignment/map_embeddings.py` | SVD, RI, SGNS |
| VI | `alignment/sgns_vi.py` | SGNS |
| WI | `alignment/wi.py` | Count, PPMI, SVD, RI, SGNS |

The script `alignment/map_embeddings.py` is drawn from [VecMap](https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap), where you can find instructions how to use it. Find examples of how to obtain OP, OP- and OP+ under `scripts/`.

Instead of WI, consider using the more advanced [Temporal Referencing](https://github.com/Garrafao/TemporalReferencing).

#### Measures

|Name | Code | Applicability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CD | `measures/cd.py` | Count, PPMI, SVD, RI, SGNS |
| LND | `measures/lnd.py` | Count, PPMI, SVD, RI, SGNS |
| JSD | - | SCAN |
| FD | `measures/freq.py` | from corpus |
| TD | `measures/typs.py` |Count|
| HD | `measures/entropy.py` | Count |

FD, TD and HD need additional applications of `measures/diff.py` and optionally `measures/trsf.py`.

### Parameter Settings

For better performance, RI and SRV should be run with `-a` option, instead of specifying the seed number manually.

Consider the application of column mean centering to RI and SGNS embeddings before applying a change measure.

Find more detailed notes on model performances and optimal parameter settings in [these papers](#bibtex).

### Evaluation

The evaluation framework of this repository is based on the comparison of a set of target words across two corpora. Hence, models can be evaluated on a triple (dataset, corpus1, corpus2), where the dataset provides gold values for the change of target words between corpus1 and corpus2.

| Dataset | Corpus 1 | Corpus 2 | Download |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DURel | DTA18 | DTA19  | [Dataset](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/experiment-daten/durel.html), [Corpora](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/wocc.html) |
| SURel | SDEWAC | COOK | [Dataset](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/experiment-daten/surel.html), [Corpora](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/wocc.html) |

You don't have to download the data manually. In `testsets/` we provide the testset versions of DURel and SURel as used in Schlechtweg et al. (2019). Additionally, we provide an evaluation pipeline, downloading the corpora and evaluating the models to the above-mentioned datasets, see [pipeline](#pipeline).

#### Metrics

|Name | Code | Applicability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spearman correlation | `evaluation/spearman.py` | DURel, SURel |

The script `evaluation/spearman.py` outputs the Spearman correlation of the two input rankings (column 3), as well as the significance of the obtained result (column 4).

Consider uploading your results for DURel as a submission to the shared task [Lexical Semantic Change Detection in German](https://codalab.lri.fr/competitions/560).

#### Pipeline

Under `scripts/` you find an example of a full evaluation pipeline for the models on two small test corpora. Assuming you are working on a UNIX-based system, first make the scripts executable with

	chmod 755 scripts/*.sh

Then run

	bash -e scripts/run_test.sh

The script first reads the two gzipped test corpora `corpora/test/corpus1/` and `corpora/test/corpus2/`. Then it produces model predictions for the targets in `testsets/test/targets.tsv` and writes them under `results/`. It finally writes the Spearman correlation between each model's predictions and the gold rank (`testsets/test/gold.tsv`) under the respective folder in `results/`. Note that the gold values for the test data are meaningless, as they were randomly assigned.

We also provide scripts to reproduce the results from Schlechtweg et al. (2019), including the corpus download. For this run either of

	bash -e scripts/run_durel.sh
	bash -e scripts/run_surel.sh

You may want to change the parameters in `scripts/parameters_durel.sh` and `scripts/parameters_surel.sh` (e.g. vector dimensionality, iterations), as running the scripts on the full parameter set will take several days and require a large amount of disk space.

### Important Changes

September 1, 2019: Python scripts were updated from Python 2 to Python 3.
